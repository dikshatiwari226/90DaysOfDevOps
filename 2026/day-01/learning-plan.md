# Day 01 Assignment– Introduction to DevOps and Cloud (Understanding of DevOps: What, Why, and How What is DevOps?)

## Task

# Q1) **What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?**

    What is DevOps?

    DevOps is a culture and practice that combines Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) to build, test, and deploy software faster and more reliably using automation and collaboration.

    Why DevOps?

    - To reduce deployment time
    - To minimize production issues
    - To improve collaboration between teams
    - To deliver features faster to customers


    How DevOps works?

    - CI/CD pipelines (automated build & deploy)
    - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
    - Monitoring & logging tools
    - Continuous testing and automation


    It focuses on:

    CI/CD (automated build, test, deploy)
    Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
    Monitoring & logging
    Collaboration between teams

    Goal: Faster releases with fewer errors
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    **Cloud Engineering** is about designing, building, and managing applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

    It focuses on:

    Cloud infrastructure setup
    Scaling applications
    Security & networking
    Cost optimization

    Goal: Run applications efficiently and securely in the cloud


    **In Baisc:-** DevOps and Cloud Engineering are **two distinct but deeply interconnected disciplines that together form the backbone of modern software delivery and infrastructure management.**

    - DevOps = How we build and deploy software efficiently
    - Cloud Engineering = Where and how we run that software in the cloud

# Q2) **Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?**

       I started learning DevOps and Cloud because I want to understand how applications are built, deployed, and scaled in real-world production environments. With my development background, I realized that knowing only coding is not enough — understanding CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and automation helps me build more reliable and scalable systems. It also aligns with current industry demand, where companies expect engineers to have both development and deployment knowledge.

      -Market Shift: Every company is moving to the cloud and needs automation to stay competitive. It’s where the industry is going.
      -Efficiency: I enjoy solving the "it works on my machine" problem by building reliable pipelines that get code to users faster.
      -End-to-End Impact: I don't just want to write code; I want to understand the entire lifecycle of how an application scales and stays secure in production.

# Q3) **Where do you want to reach?**

      My goal is to become a skilled Cloud & DevOps Engineer who can design scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure. I want to be confident in handling CI/CD pipelines, cloud architecture, monitoring, and production issues end-to-end. Long term, I aim to take ownership of cloud infrastructure and contribute to architecture-level decisions in an organization.

      In short:- I want to become a skilled Cloud & DevOps Engineer who can design scalable systems, automate deployments, and manage production environments confidently.

# Q4) How you will stay consistent every single day?

      I will stay consistent by following a clear daily plan, setting small achievable goals, and practicing hands-on every day. Even if I have limited time, I will make sure to learn or practice something related to DevOps and Cloud daily to maintain momentum.


      Expected Outcome

      By the end of this batch, my goal is to gain confidence in DevOps workflows and become capable of deploying and managing applications using modern DevOps tools and cloud platforms. I aim to secure a DevOps role in a mid-scale startup to gain practical exposure and real industry experience.
