# Day 01 Assignment– Introduction to DevOps and Cloud (Understanding of DevOps: What, Why, and How What is DevOps?)

## Task

# Q1) **What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?**

    What is DevOps?

    DevOps is a culture and practice that combines Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) to build, test, and deploy software faster and more reliably using automation and collaboration.

    Why DevOps?

    - To reduce deployment time
    - To minimize production issues
    - To improve collaboration between teams
    - To deliver features faster to customers


    How DevOps works?

    - CI/CD pipelines (automated build & deploy)
    - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
    - Monitoring & logging tools
    - Continuous testing and automation


    It focuses on:

    CI/CD (automated build, test, deploy)
    Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
    Monitoring & logging
    Collaboration between teams

    Goal: Faster releases with fewer errors
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    **Cloud Engineering** is about designing, building, and managing applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

    It focuses on:

    Cloud infrastructure setup
    Scaling applications
    Security & networking
    Cost optimization

    Goal: Run applications efficiently and securely in the cloud


    **In Baisc:-** DevOps and Cloud Engineering are **two distinct but deeply interconnected disciplines that together form the backbone of modern software delivery and infrastructure management.**

    - DevOps = How we build and deploy software efficiently
    - Cloud Engineering = Where and how we run that software in the cloud

      Expected Outcome

      By the end of this batch, my goal is to gain confidence in DevOps workflows and become capable of deploying and managing applications using modern DevOps tools and cloud platforms. I aim to secure a DevOps role in a mid-scale startup to gain practical exposure and real industry experience.
